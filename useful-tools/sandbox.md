## Developing Angular Components in Isolation

[Angular Playground](https://angularplayground.it/) is a tool that allows you to develop Angular components in isolation without the baggage of your entire app.

Key Benefits:

- Create scenarios to visualize your component in various states
- Quicker build times without recompiling your entire app
- Focus on just the component -- no auth page, account selection, selecting the data u need from a drop down before you can even see the changes you made to your component
- Living documentation - Scenarios show how the component can be used and how it will look, especially useful if developing a component to be shared across teams
- Visual Regression Testing
